  <b> What is WaterTrackr?</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div>
 <p>Watertrackr is a smart device created to track your water usage.<p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>How does it work?</b>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>The device is attached to your pipe and it uses vibrations to measure the amount of water used daily. The data is then sent to users through our app. <p>
